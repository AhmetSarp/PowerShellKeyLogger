# PowerShellKeyLogger
*It is a PowerShell code that records keystrokes both in xml and txt files. To prevent loss of file when it executed more than once, it saves the file names as "keylogger date". Xml file holds three attributes per keystroke which are "Number", "Button"(Name) and "Time" attributes.*

# How it works?
*When it starts

## Execution-Policy Problem
 In case of "this file is not digitally signed" exception.

*Execute PowerShell command "Set-ExecutionPolicy remoteSigned"*

## Usage
*Execute PowerShell command ".\keylogger.ps1" to start KeyLogger <br /> <br />*
*Press "CTRL + C" to stop*
